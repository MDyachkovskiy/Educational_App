<p id="description">
   This application was developed as part of the learning process at Geekbrains. While the application operates with mock values, the primary focus has been placed on its design and user interface. The app features dynamic design alterations based on various conditions, such as lesson times. It also involves working with different ViewHolder instances in RecyclerView. Instead of the standard BottomNavigationView, ChipNavigationView is utilized.
